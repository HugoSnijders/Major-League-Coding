The following code takes people of wikipedia data and using parameters
the user can define in python (range, two sports, country name)
creates an csv file where each observation records:
Birth Year
Death Year
Whether they belong to a certain country or not:
and if so:
	If they are not an athlete (if they do not belong
	to the country this is recorded as them not 
	being an athlete)
	If they are an athlete of sport 1
	If they are an athlete of sport 2
	If thy are an athlete of both sports
The R file then calculates the age and mean average life expectancy
for each birth year, and graphs that for the different groups 
in unison.
